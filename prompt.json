    "In the year 2048, the world was a very different place from what it had been just two decades before. The pace of technological progress had quickened to an almost unimaginable degree, and the changes that had swept through society as a result were nothing short of revolutionary.\nIn many ways, the year 2048 represented the culmination of a long and tumultuous journey that humanity had been on since the dawn of civilization. The great leaps forward in science and technology that had occurred over the course of the previous century had laid the groundwork for a future that was beyond anything anyone could have imagined.\nOne of the most striking aspects of life in 2048 was the degree to which technology had become an integral part of nearly every aspect of daily existence. From the moment people woke up in the morning until they went to bed at night, they were surrounded by devices and systems that were powered by advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms.\nIn fact, it was hard to find anything in people's lives that wasn't touched by technology in some way. Every aspect of society had been transformed, from the way people communicated with one another to the way they worked, played, and even socialized. And as the years went on, it seemed as though there was no limit to what technology could achieve.\nDespite all of these advances, however, not everyone was happy with the state of the world in 2048. Some people saw the increasing reliance on technology as a sign that humanity was losing touch with its own humanity, and they worried about the implications of this for the future.\nOthers were more pragmatic, recognizing that while technology had brought many benefits, it also posed new challenges and risks that needed to be addressed. As a result, there was a growing movement of people who were working to ensure that the advances of technology were used in ways that were safe, ethical, and beneficial for everyone.\nOne person who was at the forefront of this movement was a young woman named Maya. Maya was a brilliant and ambitious researcher who had dedicated her life to understanding the implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and biotechnology. She was deeply concerned about the potential risks and unintended consequences of these technologies, and she worked tirelessly to raise awareness about the need for responsible innovation.\nMaya's work had earned her a reputation as one of the most influential voices in the field of technology and ethics, and she was widely respected for her deep understanding of the issues and her ability to communicate complex ideas in ways that were accessible and engaging. She was also known for her passionate and inspiring speeches, which often left her audiences with a sense of purpose and determination to make the world a better place through their own efforts.\nOne day, Maya received an invitation to speak at a major conference on technology and ethics, which was being held in a large convention center in the heart of the city. The conference was expected to attract thousands of people from all over the world, and there was a great deal of excitement and anticipation about what Maya would say.\nAs she prepared for her speech, Maya knew that she had a big responsibility on her shoulders. She felt a deep sense of obligation to use her platform to inspire others to take action and make a difference in the world, and she was determined to do everything in her power to live up to this responsibility.\nWhen the day of the conference arrived, Maya was filled with a mixture of excitement and nerves. She spent hours rehearsing her speech and fine-tuning her ideas, making sure that she had everything just right. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, it was time for her to take the stage.\nAs she stepped up to the podium, Maya could feel the energy of the crowd surging around her. She took a deep breath and began to speak, her voice strong and clear as she outlined the challenges and opportunities facing society in the age of technology. She spoke passionately about the need for responsible innovation and the importance of considering the ethical implications of our actions, and she inspired many people in the audience to take up this cause and make a difference in their own lives.\nOverall, Maya's speech was a resounding success, and she received countless messages of gratitude and appreciation from those who had heard her speak. She knew that there was still much work to be done, but she felt hopeful about the future and the role that technology could play in creating a better world for all. \nAs Maya left the stage and made her way back to her seat, she couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment at what she had just accomplished. She knew that her words had the power to inspire others and make a real difference in the world, and she was grateful for the opportunity to have played a part in this important work. \nFor Maya, the future was full of promise and possibility, and she was determined to continue doing everything in her power to help create a brighter, more ethical world for everyone.\nAs she ",
    "Once upon a time, there existed a little girl who liked to have adventures. She wanted to go to places and meet new people, and have fun. However, her parents were always telling her to stay close to home, to be careful, and to avoid any danger. But the little girl was stubborn, and she wanted to see what was on the other side of the mountain. So she sneaked out of the house one night, leaving a note for her parents, and set off on her journey. As she climbed the mountain, the little girl felt a sense of excitement and wonder. She had never been this far away from home before, and she couldnt wait to see what she would find on the other side. She climbed higher and higher, her lungs burning from the thin air, until she finally reached the top of the mountain. And there, she found a beautiful meadow filled with wildflowers and a sparkling stream. The little girl danced and played in the meadow, feeling free and alive. She knew she had to return home eventually, but for now, she was content to enjoy her adventure. As the sun began to set, the little girl reluctantly made her way back down the mountain, but she knew that she would never forget her adventure and the joy of discovering something new and exciting. And whenever she felt scared or unsure, she would remember the thrill of climbing the mountain and the beauty of the meadow on the other side, and she would know that she could face any challenge that came her way, with courage and determination. She carried the memories of her journey in her heart, a constant reminder of the strength she possessed. The little girl returned home to her worried parents, who had discovered her note and anxiously awaited her arrival. They scolded her for disobeying their instructions and venturing into the unknown. But as they looked into her sparkling eyes and saw the glow on her face, their anger softened. They realized that their little girl had grown, that she had experienced something extraordinary. The little girl shared her tales of the mountain and the meadow with her parents, painting vivid pictures with her words. She spoke of the breathtaking view from the mountaintop, where the world seemed to stretch endlessly before her. She described the delicate petals of the wildflowers, vibrant hues that danced in the gentle breeze. And she recounted the soothing melody of the sparkling stream, its waters reflecting the golden rays of the setting sun. Her parents listened intently, captivated by her story. They realized that their daughter had discovered a part of herself on that journey—a spirit of curiosity and a thirst for exploration. They saw that she had learned valuable lessons about independence, resilience, and the beauty that lies beyond ones comfort zone. From that day forward, the little girls parents encouraged her to pursue her dreams and embrace new experiences.

They supported her as she continued to embark on adventures, always reminding her to stay safe but never stifling her spirit. As the years passed, the little girl grew into a remarkable woman, fearlessly exploring the world and making a difference wherever she went. The lessons she had learned on that fateful journey stayed with her, guiding her through challenges and inspiring her to live life to the fullest. And so, the once timid little girl became a symbol of courage and resilience, a reminder to all who knew her that the greatest joys in life often lie just beyond the mountains we fear to climb. Her story spread far and wide, inspiring others to embrace their own journeys and discover the wonders that awaited them. In the end, the little girls adventure became a timeless tale, passed down through generations, reminding us all that sometimes, the greatest rewards come to those who dare to step into the unknown and follow their hearts. With each passing day, the little girls story continued to inspire countless individuals, igniting a spark within their souls and encouraging them to embark on their own extraordinary adventures. The tale of her bravery and determination resonated deeply with people from all walks of life, reminding them of the limitless possibilities that awaited them beyond the boundaries of their comfort zones. People marveled at the little girls unwavering spirit and her unwavering belief in the power of dreams. They saw themselves reflected in her journey, finding solace in the knowledge that they too could overcome their fears and pursue their passions. The little girl's story became a beacon of hope, a testament to the human spirit",
    "Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a young girl named Sophia. Sophia lived in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. She had grown up in this village all her life, and had never known anything beyond its borders.\n\nOne day, Sophia was out in the forest gathering herbs for her mother's potion shop when she stumbled upon a hidden path she had never seen before. Curious, she decided to follow it. The path wound through the forest, leading her deeper and deeper into the woods.\n\nAs she walked, the trees grew taller and the air grew colder. Sophia began to feel a sense of unease, as if she was being watched. She tried to shake off the feeling, but it only grew stronger. Suddenly, she heard a low growl behind her.\n\nSophia spun around, but there was no one there. The growl came again, this time louder and closer. She saw a pair of glowing eyes peering out from behind a tree. Sophia's heart raced as she realized she was face to face with a wild beast.\n\nBut as she looked into the beast's eyes, she saw something unexpected - kindness. The beast, a great brown bear, seemed to be studying her with a curious expression. Sophia hesitated for a moment, then reached out her hand to touch the bear's fur.\n\nTo her surprise, the bear did not attack. Instead, it nuzzled her hand and let out a soft growl. Sophia felt a sense of wonder and excitement wash over her. She had never imagined that she would make friends with a wild animal.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Sophia and the bear became inseparable. They spent their days exploring the forest together, playing games, and sharing secrets. Sophia learned that the bear's name was Boris, and that he had been living in the forest for as long as anyone could remember.\n\nAs the days passed, Sophia grew to love Boris more and more. She had never felt such a deep connection with anyone or anything before. She realized that she had been living her life in a bubble, never venturing beyond the boundaries of her village. But with Boris by her side, she felt like she could explore the world and discover all its wonders.\n\nOne day, as they were out on a walk, Sophia and Boris stumbled upon a hidden clearing deep in the forest. In the center of the clearing was a beautiful tree, its branches heavy with fruit. Sophia had never seen anything like it before.\n\n\"This is the Tree of Life,\" Boris said, his voice filled with reverence. \"It is said to have the power to grant wishes to those who eat its fruit.\"\n\nSophia's eyes widened in amazement. She had always heard stories of the Tree of Life, but she had never believed they were true. But here it was, right in front of her.\n\nBoris nudged her gently. \"Do you have a wish, Sophia?\" he asked.\n\nSophia thought for a moment. She had always dreamed of exploring the world beyond her village, but she had never had the courage to do so. But now, with Boris by her side, she felt like anything was possible.\n\n\"I wish to see the world beyond our village,\" she said, her voice trembling with excitement.\n\nBoris nodded, and together they climbed the tree and plucked a fruit from its branches. Sophia took a bite, and suddenly she felt a strange sensation wash over her. She felt lighter, freer, as if she could go anywhere and do anything.\n\nWhen she opened her eyes, she found herself standing in a bustling city, surrounded by towering buildings and strange creatures. She had never seen anything like it before. But with Boris by her side, she felt like she could conquer anything.\n\nAnd so, Sophia and Boris set out on a journey to explore the world beyond their village. They traveled to distant lands, met new people, and discovered new wonders. They had many adventures, but they always remained the best of friends.\n\nYears passed, and Sophia grew old, but she never forgot the lessons she had learned from Boris. She had discovered that there was a whole world out there, full of wonder and magic, and that with courage and kindness, anything was possible.\n\nFinally, after many long days and nights, Sophia found the spellbook hidden in a hollow tree. She opened it, and the pages filled with the sorcerer's magic and wisdom. She read the words of the spell, and as she did, the garden began to flourish once again. The flowers bloomed, the trees bore fruit, and the stream ran clear and sparkling.Sophia returned to the garden, where she lived out the rest of her days, tending to the plants and animals, and sharing the wisdom of the sorcerer and the magic of the garden with all who sought it. And the garden remained a place of eternal beauty and peace, a testament to the power of love and the importance of caring for the earth and all its creatures.",
    "It is done, and submitted. You can play 'Survival of the Tastiest' on Android, and on the web. Playing on the web works, but you have to simulate multiple touch for table moving and that can be a bit confusing. There is a lot I'd like to talk about. I will go through every topic, insted of making the typical what went right/wrong list. Concept Working over the theme was probably one of the hardest tasks which I had to face. Originally, I had an idea of what kind of game I wanted to develop, gameplay wise - something with a lot of enemies/actors, simple graphics, maybe set in space, controlled from a top-down view. I was confident that I could fit any theme around it. In the end, the problem with a theme like 'Evolution' in a game is that evolution is unassisted. It happens through several seemingly random mutations over time, with the most apt permutation surviving. This genetic car simulator is, in my opinion, a great example of actual evolution of a species facing a challenge. But is it a game? In a game, you need to control something to reach an objective. That control goes against what evolution is supposed to be like. If you allow the user to pick how to evolve something, it's not evolution anymore - it's the equivalent of intelligent design, the fable invented by creationists to combat the idea of evolution. Being agnostic and a Pastafarian, that's not something that rubbed me the right way. Hence, my biggest dillema when deciding what to create was not with what I wanted to create, but with what I did not. I didn't want to create an 'intelligent design' simulator and wrongly call it evolution. This is a problem, of course, every other contestant also had to face. And judging by the entries submitted, not many managed to work around it. I'd say the only real solution was through the use of artificial selection, somehow. So far, I have not seen any entry using this at its core gameplay. Alas, this is just a fun competition and after a while I decided not to be as strict with the game idea, and allowed myself to pick whatever I thought would work out. My initial idea was to create something where humanity tried to evolve to a next level but had some kind of foe trying to stop them from doing so. I kind of had this image of human souls flying in space towards a monolith or a space baby (all based in 2001: A Space Odyssey of course) but I couldn't think of compelling (read: serious) mechanics for that. Borgs were my next inspiration, as their whole hypothesis fit pretty well into the evolution theme. But how to make it work? Are you the borg, or fighting the Borg? The third and final idea came to me through my girlfriend, who somehow gave me the idea of making something about the evolution of Pasta. The more I thought about it the more it sounded like it would work, so I decided to go with it. Conversations with my inspiring co-worker Roushey (who also created the 'Mechanical Underdogs' signature logo for my intros) further matured the concept, as it involved into the idea of having individual pieces of pasta flying around and trying to evolve until they became all-powerful. A secondary idea here was that the game would work to explain how the Flying Spaghetti Monster came to exist - by evolving from a normal dinner table. So the idea evolved more or less into this: you are sitting a table. You have your own plate, with is your 'base'. There are 5 other guests at the table, each with their own plate. Your plate can spawn little pieces of pasta. You do so by 'ordering' them through a menu. Some pastas are better than others; some are faster, some are stronger. They have varying 'costs', which are debited from your credits (you start with a number of credits). Once spawned, your pastas start flying around. Their instinct is to fly to other plates, in order to conquer them (the objective of the game is having your pasta conquer all the plates on the table). But they are really autonomous, so after being spawned, you have no control over your pasta (think DotA or LoL creeps). Your pasta doesn't like other people's pasta, so if they meet, they shoot sauce at each other until one dies. You get credits for other pastas your own pasta kill. Once a pasta is in the vicinity of a plate,",
    "“You’re an idiot,” she said.\nI smiled and leaned back in the chair, looking at her over my glasses. “No, I’m not.”\n“If you were smart you would have learned to dance years ago. You’ve got two left feet.” She held up both of her hands with four fingers extended then made a circular motion that looked like an airplane.\nI leaned forward and put my glasses on the table in front of me, reaching for her hands as I did so, grabbing them before they could leave mine. “The next time you do something like this, call me. The phone number is right here,” I said as I pointed at a piece of paper under a stack of papers on my desk.\n“Fine,” she huffed and turned to leave the room. But she stopped at the doorway when she saw the bookshelves that lined one wall. “What are these for?” She stepped closer, tilting her head back and forth as she looked up. The shelves were three stories high with stacks of books on every level.\n“Books.” I smiled again. “I have a lot of books.”\nShe didn’t respond to that so I continued: “And there are more in the basement.”\n“But you can’t move them all here, right? This place is just too small for all those books. Maybe we should look for a bigger office building.” She looked back at me but said nothing as she took another few steps towards the door and then stopped again when she saw my grandfather clock on the wall.\n“And this?” she pointed to the clock, which had been in the family for over seventy years. “It’s just a clock isn’t it?”\nI laughed. “You can say that, but I know better.” It was then that I told her my grandfather’s story. He made that clock, and it was his favorite possession. When he died she inherited the clock; or at least she thought she did. After a few weeks of trying to sell it on eBay, she gave up because no one would pay what she felt it was worth.\n“You should have had an auction,” she suggested, leaning in towards me again. “Then maybe you could get more for it.”\n“No,” I shook my head. “I don’t want to sell the clock.”\nShe smiled, but this time it didn’t reach her eyes. She took a step back and looked at me again, not saying anything, just staring. The only sound was the ticking of the grandfather clock in the background as she waited for my next words.\n“My grandfather made this clock. He did everything by hand.” I could see that she had no idea what to say or do so I continued: “It’s his favorite possession, and it means more to me than anything else he ever owned. So, if you want the books, you can have them…” I looked at her face for just a second before continuing, “but you won’t take the clock.”\nShe finally responded with: “But what about the money?” She looked around again and said, “I think we could make more selling these books than you would get from all of them. You must have thousands of books here!”\nI took another step forward and put my hand on her shoulder as I spoke to her in a very low voice. “You’ve got it all wrong,” I told her. “There are only two or three hundred books. I’m not looking for money – I’m looking for someone who understands how important this clock is.”\n“How much do you want for the books?” she asked, still staring at me intently as she waited for my answer.\n“Forget about the money,” I said again. “If you really want to buy them, we can take our time and talk more later. But if you just want their value in paperbacks, that’s not what they’re worth.” She still seemed confused by everything I had said so far, so I tried to simplify my words as much as possible: “The books are mine; the clock is my grandfather’s. These books have been passed down through several generations of our family and are irreplaceable. Do you understand?”\n“I guess not,” she answered as she walked away from me, still looking at me but not saying a word. She took two more steps before turning around to say one last thing: “Well, good luck with the books, then.” With that, she went back into her house and out of sight, still walking without talking.\nAfter a few minutes, I slowly walked back toward my grandfather’s home.",
    "The sun was setting over the horizon, casting long shadows across the dusty ground of the town square. The last rays of light streamed through the gaps between the buildings, illuminating the cobblestones and the people milling about. A group of children played a rough game of tag, their laughter filling the air.\nIn the center of the square stood a lone figure, a man with a tired face and weary eyes. He was tall and broad shouldered, but his posture was slumped and his head hung low. Despite the warmth of the day, he wore a thick woolen coat that seemed too heavy for the weather.\nThe man looked out at the crowd, his gaze sweeping over the faces of the townspeople as they went about their business. His eyes settled on a young woman standing on the edge of the square, watching him with curiosity. She was pretty, with chestnut hair pulled back into a ponytail and bright green eyes that sparkled in the fading light.\nThe man felt a sudden jolt of recognition, as if he had seen her before. But he couldn't remember where or when. He tried to shake off the feeling, but it lingered like a ghostly presence.\nSuddenly, the woman's eyes widened in alarm, and she began to run towards him. Her movements were urgent and panicked, as if she was trying to escape something or someone. The man watched her go, his confusion growing with each step.\nHe turned to look around the square, but there was no sign of anyone else. It was as if the woman had appeared out of nowhere, and now she was gone just as suddenly.\nThe man rubbed his temples, feeling a mounting sense of unease. He tried to make sense of what he had just seen, but it was like trying to grasp smoke in his hands. He shook his head, frustrated with himself for being so easily spooked.\nJust then, a voice called out from behind him. \"Hey there! You look lost.\"\nThe man turned to see a young man standing behind him, a friendly smile on his face. He was tall and lean, with tousled blond hair that seemed to glow in the fading light. His eyes were bright and curious, as if he was eager to know everything about the world around him.\nThe man hesitated for a moment, unsure of how to respond. He wasn't used to talking to strangers, especially ones who looked so young and innocent. But there was something about the boy that made him feel comfortable, as if he had known him all his life.\n\"I'm not lost,\" he said finally, his voice gruff but friendly. \"Just a little confused, I guess.\"\nThe boy grinned. \"Well, I can help with that! My name is Jake, by the way. What's your name?\"\nThe man hesitated for a moment, then introduced himself as Michael. They chatted for a few minutes, exchanging small talk and pleasantries. But even as they spoke, the man couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. It was as if he had forgotten something important, something that he needed to remember before it was too late.\nHe excused himself from Jake, promising to come back later and chat some more. As he walked away, he felt a growing sense of unease. Something wasn't right, and he needed to figure out what it was before it was too late.\n[CHAPTER 4:  \nTHE LIBRARY](9781441125608_epub_itb-ch4.xhtml)\nThe man returned to the library, his mind still racing with thoughts of the mysterious boy and the strange feeling that had been nagging at him all day. He wandered through the shelves, scanning the titles of books and flipping through their pages, searching for something that might help him remember what he had forgotten.\nIt wasn't until he stumbled upon a book on ancient myths and legends that he felt a spark of recognition. As he read through the stories of gods and monsters, he began to recall fragments of memories from his own life. Memories of strange symbols carved into walls, of dreams filled with images of a dark forest and a mysterious figure.\nHe realized with a start that these were not just random memories, but pieces of a larger puzzle that had been scattered throughout his life. He felt a sudden urgency to put them together before they faded away completely.\nAs he continued to read through the book, he began to notice patterns and connections between the myths and his own memories. The symbols he had seen as a child were not just random carvings, but part of an ancient language that held the key to unlocking the secrets of his past.\nWith newfound determination, the man decided to use every resource at his disposal to solve the mystery of his life. He began to scour books and artifacts, piecing together fragments of information until they formed a clear picture of what had really happened to him.\nThe truth was stranger than he could have ever imagined, and it led him on a journey that would take him deep into the heart of the enigmatic city where he had lived his entire life. The deeper he delved, the more he realized that his past was connected to a dark conspiracy that had been hidden from him for his own protection.\nAs he uncovered the truth, he also discovered that he was not alone in his quest. There were others who shared his memories and knew the secrets of the city's hidden history. They banded together to form a small community, each contributing their unique talents to uncover the truth about their past lives.\nTogether, they began to piece together a stunning picture of a world that had been lost for centuries, a world where magic and technology had coexisted in perfect harmony. They discovered artifacts and documents that revealed the true extent of the city's power and influence, and how it had affected the course of human history.\nBut with this newfound knowledge came danger and intrigue, as powerful forces sought to keep the secrets of the past buried forever. The man and his companions found themselves in a desperate race against time, trying to uncover everything they could about their past lives before it was too late.\nAs the truth came into focus, the man realized that he had been given a second chance at life, a chance to make amends for the mistakes of his past and to ensure that the truth would never be forgotten again. He knew that his journey was far from over, but he was ready to face whatever lay ahead, armed with the knowledge that he had spent a lifetime accumulating. \n[CHAPTER 5:  \nTHE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE](9781441125608_epub_itb-ch5.xhtml)\nThe man's heart raced as he stumbled upon a clue that might lead him to the mysterious figure from his memories. He had been searching for weeks, scouring the city's forgotten corners and reading every book he could find that might hold a clue. And finally, he had found something.\nIt was a small, hand-drawn map that seemed to show the location of an underground chamber deep beneath the city. The map was old and faded, but the man could make out several landmarks that matched up with his own memories of the dark forest. He felt a thrill of excitement at the thought that he might finally uncover the truth about the figure he had seen so many years ago.\nThe man quickly gathered a team of fellow seekers and set out to find the chamber. They followed the map through a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, each step echoing off the walls in the eerie darkness. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and ancient stone, and the man could feel the weight of history bearing down on him as they went deeper into the underground maze.\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, they reached their destination: a small chamber filled with strange symbols and markings that seemed to be connected to the mysterious figure from his memories. The man's heart raced as he began to decipher the code, piecing together words and phrases that had been lost for centuries.\nAs he worked, a sudden noise interrupted him. He spun around, his hand already reaching for the hilt of his hidden blade, ready for whatever danger might be lurking in the shadows. But to his surprise, he saw a figure stepping out from behind a stack of crates, their face obscured by a hooded cloak.\nThe man's heart sank as he realized that this was not the mysterious figure from his memories, but someone else entirely. Still, he kept his wits about him and addressed the stranger cautiously.\n\"Who are you?\" he asked, his voice low and steady. \"What do you know about the one I'm looking for?\"\nThe stranger hesitated for a moment before speaking in a hushed tone. \"I might be able to help,\" they said. \"But you have to promise me one thing: you must never reveal what you're about to hear to anyone. Not even your closest allies.\"\nThe man nodded, his mind racing with the possibilities of what he was about to learn. He knew that this stranger held the key to unlocking the secrets of his past, and he was ready to do whatever it took to get the answers he had been seeking for so long. \n[CHAPTER 6:  \nTHE DARK FOREST](9781441125608_epub_itb-ch6.xhtml)\nThe man awoke with a start, the dream still fresh in his mind. He could see it all so clearly, as if it were etched into his memory like a brand into his skin. The dark forest stretched out before him, the thick canopy of leaves overhead. It was then that he heard the rustling of leaves and the soft earth beneath him.\nHe stood there, amidst the trees, his senses strained with the sounds of the birds chirping and the wind whispering through the branches above. He looked down at the forest, dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves, casting shadows across the ground as it seemed to beaten gold it cast a warm light",
    "461 U.S. 238 (1983) OLIM ET AL. v. WAKINEKONA No. 81-1581. Supreme Court of United States. Argued January 19, 1983. Decided April 26, 1983. CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT *239 Michael A. Lilly, First Deputy Attorney General of Hawaii, argued the cause for petitioners. With him on the brief was James H. Dannenberg, Deputy Attorney General. Robert Gilbert Johnston argued the cause for respondent. With him on the brief was Clayton C. Ikei.[*] *240 JUSTICE BLACKMUN delivered the opinion of the Court. The issue in this case is whether the transfer of a prisoner from a state prison in Hawaii to one in California implicates a liberty interest within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. I A Respondent Delbert Kaahanui Wakinekona is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole as a result of his murder conviction in a Hawaii state court. He also is serving sentences for various other crimes, including rape, robbery, and escape. At the Hawaii State Prison outside Honolulu, respondent was classified as a maximum security risk and placed in the maximum control unit. Petitioner Antone Olim is the Administrator of the Hawaii State Prison. The other petitioners constituted a prison 'Program Committee.' On August 2, 1976, the Committee held hearings to determine the reasons for a breakdown in discipline and the failure of certain programs within the prison's maximum control unit. Inmates of the unit appeared at these hearings. The Committee singled out respondent and another inmate as troublemakers. On August 5, respondent received notice that the Committee, at a hearing to be held on August 10, would review his correctional program to determine whether his classification within the system should be changed and whether he should be transferred to another Hawaii facility or to a mainland institution. *241 The August 10 hearing was conducted by the same persons who had presided over the hearings on August 2. Respondent retained counsel to represent him. The Committee recommended that respondent's classification as a maximum security risk be continued and that he be transferred to a prison on the mainland. He received the following explanation from the Committee: 'The Program Committee, having reviewed your entire file, your testimony and arguments by your counsel, concluded that your control classification remains at Maximum. You are still considered a security risk in view of your escapes and subsequent convictions for serious felonies. The Committee noted the progress you made in vocational training and your expressed desire to continue in this endeavor. However your relationship with staff, who reported that you threaten and intimidate them, raises grave concerns regarding your potential for further disruptive and violent behavior. Since there is no other Maximum security prison in Hawaii which can offer you the correctional programs you require and you cannot remain at [the maximum control unit] because of impending construction of a new facility, the Program Committee recommends your transfer to an institution on the mainland.' App. 7-8. Petitioner Olim, as Administrator, accepted the Committee's recommendation, and a few days later respondent was transferred to Folsom State Prison in California. B Rule IV of the Supplementary Rules and Regulations of the Corrections Division, Department of Social Services and Housing, State of Hawaii, approved in June 1976, recites that the inmate classification process is not concerned with punishment. Rather, it is intended to promote the best interests *242 of the inmate, the State, and the prison community.[1] Paragraph 3 of Rule IV requires a hearing prior to a prison transfer involving 'a grievous loss to the inmate,' which the Rule defines 'generally' as 'a serious loss to a reasonable man.' App. 21.[2] The Administrator, under ¶ 2 of the Rule, is required to establish 'an impartial Program Committee' to conduct such a hearing, the Committee to be 'composed of at least three members who were not actively involved in the process by which the inmate . . . was brought before the Committee.' App. 20. Under ¶ 3, the Committee must give the inmate written notice of the hearing, permit him, with certain stated exceptions, to confront and cross-examine witnesses, afford him an opportunity to be heard, and apprise him of the Committee's findings. App. 21-24.[3] The Committee is directed to make a recommendation to the Administrator, who then decides what action to take: '[The Administrator] may, as the final decisionmaker: '(a) Affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, the recommendation; or '(b) hold in abeyance any action he believes jeopardizes the safety, security, or welfare of the staff, inmate *243. . . , other inmates . . . , institution, or community and refer the matter back to the Program Committee for further study and recommendation.' Rule IV, ¶ 3d(3), App. 24. The regulations contain no standards governing the Administrator's exercise of his discretion. See Lono v. Ariyoshi, 63 Haw. 138, 144-145, 621 P. 2d 976, 980-981 (1981). C Respondent filed suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 against petitioners as the state officials who caused his transfer. He alleged that he had been denied procedural due process because the Committee that recommended his transfer consisted of the same persons who had initiated the hearing, this being in specific violation of Rule IV, ¶ 2, and because the Committee was biased against him. The United States District Court for the District of Hawaii dismissed the complaint, holding that the Hawaii regulations governing prison transfers do not create a substantive liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause. 459 F. Supp. 473 (1978).[4] The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a divided vote, reversed. 664 F. 2d 708 (1981). It held that Hawaii had created a constitutionally protected liberty interest by promulgating Rule IV. In so doing, the court declined to follow cases from other Courts of Appeals holding that certain procedures mandated by prison transfer regulations do not create a liberty interest. See, e. g., Cofone v. Manson, 594 F. 2d 934 (CA2 1979); Lombardo v. Meachum, 548 F. 2d 13 (CA1 1977). The court reasoned that Rule IV gives Hawaii prisoners a justifiable expectation that they will not be transferred to the mainland absent a hearing, before an impartial committee, concerning the facts alleged in the *244 prehearing notice.[5] Because the Court of Appeals' decision created a conflict among the Circuits, and because the case presents the further question whether the Due Process Clause in and of itself protects against interstate prison transfers, we granted certiorari. 456 U. S. 1005 (1982). II In Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976), and Montanye v. Haymes, 427 U. S. 236 (1976), this Court held that an intrastate prison transfer does not directly implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. ",
    "In Meachum, inmates at a Massachusetts medium security prison had been transferred to a maximum security prison in that Commonwealth. In Montanye, a companion case, an inmate had been transferred from one maximum security New York prison to another as punishment for a breach of prison rules. This Court rejected 'the notion that any grievous loss visited upon a person by the State is sufficient to invoke the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause.' Meachum, 427 U. S., at 224 (emphasis in original). It went on to state: 'The initial decision to assign the convict to a particular institution is not subject to audit under the Due Process Clause, although the degree of confinement in one prison may be quite different from that in another. The conviction has sufficiently extinguished the defendant's liberty *245 interest to empower the State to confine him in any of its prisons. 'Neither, in our view, does the Due Process Clause in and of itself protect a duly convicted prisoner against transfer from one institution to another within the state prison system. Confinement in any of the State's institutions is within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose.' Id., at 224-225 (emphasis in original). The Court observed that, although prisoners retain a residuum of liberty, see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 555-556 (1974), a holding that 'any substantial deprivation imposed by prison authorities triggers the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would subject to judicial review a wide spectrum of discretionary actions that traditionally have been the business of prison administrators rather than of the federal courts.' 427 U. S., at 225 (emphasis in original). Applying the Meachum and Montanye principles in Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S. 480 (1980), this Court held that the transfer of an inmate from a prison to a mental hospital did implicate a liberty interest. Placement in the mental hospital was 'not within the range of conditions of confinement to which a prison sentence subjects an individual,' because it brought about 'consequences . . . qualitatively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime.' Id., at 493. Respondent argues that the same is true of confinement of a Hawaii prisoner on the mainland, and that Vitek therefore controls. We do not agree. Just as an inmate has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular prison within a State, he has no justifiable expectation that he will be incarcerated in any particular State.[6] Often, confinement *246 in the inmate's home State will not be possible. A person convicted of a federal crime in a State without a federal correctional facility usually will serve his sentence in another State. Overcrowding and the need to separate particular prisoners may necessitate interstate transfers. For any number of reasons, a State may lack prison facilities capable of providing appropriate correctional programs for all offenders. Statutes and interstate agreements recognize that, from time to time, it is necessary to transfer inmates to prisons in other States. On the federal level, 18 U. S. C. § 5003(a) authorizes the Attorney General to contract with a State for the transfer of a state prisoner to a federal prison, whether in that State or another. See Howe v. Smith, 452 U. S. 473 (1981).[7] Title 18 U. S. C. § 4002 (1976 ed. and Supp. V) permits the Attorney General to contract with any State for the placement of a federal prisoner in state custody for up to three years. Neither statute requires that the prisoner remain in the State in which he was convicted and sentenced. On the state level, many States have statutes providing for the transfer of a state prisoner to a federal prison, e. g., Haw. Rev. Stat. § 353-18 (1976), or another State's prison, e. g., Alaska Stat. Ann. § 33.30.100 (1982). Corrections compacts between States, implemented by statutes, authorize incarceration of a prisoner of one State in another State's prison. See, e. g., Cal. Penal Code Ann. § 11189 (West 1982) (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); § 11190 (codifying Western Interstate Corrections Compact); Conn. Gen. *247 Stat. § 18-102 (1981) (codifying New England Interstate Corrections Compact); § 18-106 (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); Haw. Rev. Stat. § 355-1 (1976) (codifying Western Interstate Corrections Compact); Idaho Code § 20-701 (1979) (codifying Interstate Corrections Compact); Ky. Rev. Stat. § 196.610 (1982) (same). And prison regulations such as Hawaii's Rule IV anticipate that inmates sometimes will be transferred to prisons in other States. In short, it is neither unreasonable nor unusual for an inmate to serve practically his entire sentence in a State other than the one in which he was convicted and sentenced, or to be transferred to an out-of-state prison after serving a portion of his sentence in his home State. Confinement in another State, unlike confinement in a mental institution, is 'within the normal limits or range of custody which the conviction has authorized the State to impose.' Meachum, 427 U. S., at 225.[8] Even when, as here, the transfer involves long distances and an ocean crossing, the confinement remains within constitutional limits. The difference between such a transfer and an intrastate or interstate transfer of *248 shorter distance is a matter of degree, not of kind,[9] and Meachum instructs that 'the determining factor is the nature of the interest involved rather than its weight.' 427 U. S., at 224. The reasoning of Meachum and Montanye compels the conclusion that an interstate prison transfer, including one from Hawaii to California, does not deprive an inmate of any liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause in and of itself. III The Court of Appeals held that Hawaii's prison regulations create a constitutionally protected liberty interest. In Meachum, however, the State had 'conferred no right on the *249 prisoner to remain in the prison to which he was initially assigned, defeasible only upon proof of specific acts of misconduct,' 427 U. S., at 226, and 'ha[d] not represented that transfers [would] occur only on the occurrence of certain events,' id., at 228. Because the State had retained 'discretion to transfer [the prisoner] for whatever reason or for no reason at all,' ibid., the Court found that the State had not created a constitutionally protected liberty interest. Similarly, because the state law at issue in Montanye 'impose[d] no conditions on the discretionary power to transfer,' 427 U. S., at 243, there was no basis for invoking the protections of the Due Process Clause. These cases demonstrate that a State creates a protected liberty interest by placing substantive limitations on official discretion. An inmate must show 'that particularized standards or criteria guide the State's decisionmakers.' Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat, 452 U. S. 458, 467 (1981) (BRENNAN, J., concurring). If the decisionmaker is not 'required to base its decisions on objective and defined criteria,' but instead 'can deny the requested relief for any constitutionally permissible reason or for no reason at all,' ibid., the State has not created a constitutionally protected liberty interest. See id., at 466-467 (opinion of the Court); see also Vitek v. Jones, 445 U. S., at 488-491 (summarizing cases). Hawaii's prison regulations place no substantive limitations on official discretion and thus create no liberty interest entitled to protection under the Due Process Clause. As Rule IV itself makes clear, and as the Supreme Court of Hawaii has held in Lono v. Ariyoshi, 63 Haw., at 144-145, 621 P. 2d, at 980-981, the prison Administrator's discretion to transfer an inmate is completely unfettered. No standards govern or restrict the Administrator's determination. Because the Administrator is the only decisionmaker under Rule IV, we need not decide whether the introductory paragraph *250 of Rule IV, see n. 1, supra, places any substantive limitations on the purely advisory Program Committee.[10] The Court of Appeals thus erred in attributing significance to the fact that the prison regulations require a particular kind of hearing before the Administrator can exercise his unfettered discretion.[11] As the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently stated in Shango v. Jurich, 681 F. 2d 1091, 1100-1101 (1982), '[a] liberty interest is of course a substantive interest of an individual; it cannot be the right to demand needless formality.'[12] Process is"
